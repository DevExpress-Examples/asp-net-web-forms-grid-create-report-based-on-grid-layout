# How to convert and then print an ASPxGridView by using the XtraReport


<p>This example demonstrates how to dynamically create a report based upon the ASPxGridView control at runtime.  This means that all filtering, sorting and grouping conditions selected in the grid are also applied in a report. To accomplish this task, it is necessary to create a report with all the necessary bands, bind it to a data source and adjust all the necessary options.You can use this approach if you need to display content of templated columns in your report or insert a report based on ASPxGridView to another report.</p><p><strong>See also:<br />
