# Grid View for ASP.NET Web Forms - How to create a report based on grid data
This example demonstrates how to dynamically create a [DevExpress report](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReport) based on the [ASPxGridView](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/5823/components/grid-view) control's data and layout. The resulting report maintains all sorting, grouping, and filtering settings applied to the grid. The example code exports this report to a PDF file, but you can also insert the resulting report into another report.

Follow the steps below to create a report based on the Grid View control's data:

1. Create an instance of the [XtraReport](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReport) class.
2. Bind the instance to the Grid View's data source.
3. Based on the Grid layout, create [bands](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2587/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/introduction-to-banded-reports) and add them to the report.
4. Create [report controls](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2605/detailed-guide-to-devexpress-reporting/use-report-controls) and add them to the bands.
